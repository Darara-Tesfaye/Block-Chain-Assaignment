# Block-Chain-Assaignment
This repository is for our group project on "Introduction to Blockchain," focusing on learning Solidity through Alchemy University. We aim to understand blockchain fundamentals, develop smart contracts, and create a decentralized application (DApp). Contributions from all group members are tracked to reflect our collaborative effort.
